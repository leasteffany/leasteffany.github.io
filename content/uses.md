Contains the recipes I have discovered to be tasty and budget-friendly. I made sure that I enjoy my food because it is within my monthly allowance, it's healthy, and it satisfies my hunger. These recipes are created by tweaking the recipes of my favorite homecooks on YouTube according to what's available in the market and what I enjoy eating.
