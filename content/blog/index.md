Hello worldüåê

I am excited to work on this project because this is something new to me. As a technology noob, I haven't maximize the potential of the internet and the infinite opportunities it can provide. However far behind, it's not an excuse to start. This blog serves as my attempt to learn the maze of the internet or computers in general. It's funny that this is acually my 7th attempt in creating a blog *five of which I used R and twice I tried github. I have almost finished in my sixth attempt but I deleted the my-post folder unintentionally thinking that I just cleared the post of my template but later I realized, my first post was in that folderüò≠. This experience is what I will expect in my coding journey; lots of trials and errors, endless scrolling of blogpost and forums, and long hours of trying to figure out what I did wrong. The only consolation I tell myself is that we all have to start somewhere and taking this path is rewarding in the long run. 

I created this blog to compile my experiences and lessons I gained through the years. This will be my journal to document how I spend my days. I felt like time is passing and I want to remember the little projecs I made that created the version of Steffany I am in the future. This may be a personal blog but if you have opinions on the layout, grammar, or the general vibe of this blog, I am happy to hear your thoughts. See you in the next post! üíå
